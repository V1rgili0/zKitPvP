<h1>zKitPvP - Optimised version by Virgili0_ </h1>
</div>
<p>zKitPvP is a plugin made by ImGabbo, now abandoned, for a KitPvP server with all the basic functions to make this mode work. New modifications were later made by the developer: danilotallaric

This fork of zKitPvP is optimised for large networks and many unnecessary functions inserted by a later developer have been removed.
